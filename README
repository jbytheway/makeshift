Makeshift is a way to ease the build process for programs written in C or C++
(or a mixture of the two).  It provides makefiles which, when used with GNU
make, do most of the hard work for you in dependency analysis and compilation.
You need only provide a few lines of code for each binary to fill in the gaps.

Most usefully, you need not specify what source files are to be included in the
compilation, the makediles will figure that out for you.

Note that this is intended at an *aid to developers*; it is not a portabiltiy
aid, and as such is no substitute for a fully-fledged build system such as the
GNU autotools.
